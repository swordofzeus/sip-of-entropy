# 🌀 sip-of-entropy

*A playful Python library for exploring information theory — one sip at a time.*

`sip-of-entropy` is a lightweight sandbox for learning and experimenting with core concepts in information theory, such as entropy, cross-entropy, mutual information, and basic error-correcting codes like Hamming.

Whether you're brushing up on Shannon's ideas or building your own experiments, this library is meant to be simple, readable, and hackable.
